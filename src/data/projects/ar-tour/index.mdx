## Learnings

<StoryBlock 
  section_name=""
  header="Non-Linear Design Is OK"
  description="At the beginning of this project, I felt stuck because the stakeholders didn't have a clear description of the users, even tho they had the idea in mind. Being pushed by the tight timeline, I had to start ideation and development without fully understanding the users. However, while testing the tour experience with multiple users, the desired user personas became more and more clear.
  My takeaway from this is that the design process can be flexible and non-linear, and talking to users is the best way to solve a problem."
