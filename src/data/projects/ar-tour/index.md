### Timeline

With an 8-week timeline to design and prototype the MVP, I strategically mapped out my workflows to stay on track.

## Background Research

To ensure clarity and efficiency from the start, I kicked off the project with targeted research.

### Research Questions

I began by breaking the larger challenge into smaller, actionable pieces to keep the work manageable and focused.

### Conduct Research

Understanding the market landscape was essential for building a relevant product, so I conducted competitive analysis through structured desk research, which led to a clear articulation of our unique value proposition.

To validate assumptions and uncover real user needs, I ran usability testing and user interviews. Insights from these sessions directly informed an updated set of user personas and clarified our future focus areas.

## Design Process

### Ideation

Based on the design constrains, I narrowed ideas down to the following route, and annotated it on an interactive online map (Felt Map):

## Takeaways

At the beginning of this project, I felt stuck because the stakeholders didn't have a clear description of the users, even tho they had the idea in mind. Being pushed by the tight timeline, I had to start ideation and development without fully understanding the users. However, while testing the tour experience with multiple users, the desired user personas became more and more clear.
My takeaway from this is that the design process can be flexible and non-linear, and talking to users is the best way to solve a problem.
