## Background Research

### Challenge Summary

### Research Questions

### Conduct Research

### Research Insights

## Concept Development

### Ideation

Based on the design constrains, I narrowed ideas down to the following route, and annotated it on an interactive online map (Felt Map):

### User Flow

## Deliverables

### UI Kit 

I redesigned the iOS app interface using Figma, and created fun interactions to complement the gaming elements of the tours.

### User Flow 

### Shipped Beta in App Store

## Takeaways

At the beginning of this project, I felt stuck because the stakeholders didn't have a clear description of the users, even tho they had the idea in mind. Being pushed by the tight timeline, I had to start ideation and development without fully understanding the users. However, while testing the tour experience with multiple users, the desired user personas became more and more clear.
My takeaway from this is that the design process can be flexible and non-linear, and talking to users is the best way to solve a problem.
